# mcpp -- portable C preprocessor

This is a fork of the [mcpp](http://mcpp.sourceforge.net/) fork from [ZeroC Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/mcpp).

It restores the command line functionality alongside some fixes and provides [automated builds](https://github.com/pragma37/mcpp/releases/tag/master-latest) through Github Actions.

This version of mcpp is used by the [Malt render framework](https://github.com/bnpr/Malt).
